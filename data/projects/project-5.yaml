description: The employee activity club is a sample application I developed to fulfill the need of an organization that organizes monthly activities and giveaways.  It provided a CMS interface for managing content behind the scenes and restricted access to certain features based on an authorization scheme.  This was an early project to sharpen my development abilities.
