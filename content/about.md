## About

My name is Ryan Timmons, and I have a talent for developing performant software and web applications.
I am a software developer in the San Antonio area. During my career, I have built-up a solid foundation of experience that enables me to develop solutions to challenging development problems.

I place a heavy emphasis on continuing education, as well as exploring new technologies and approaches. I have no issue operating in unknown waters and embrace the challenge.

I've come into contact with a wide variety of development tools, languages, and frameworks, and I've made sure to employ and familiarize myself with many of these tools. This has run the gamut with everything from client-side essentials (HTML, CSS, JavaScript, JSP) to back-end frameworks (SpringMVC, Ruby on Rails, Express) and many things in between.

I enjoy working with a team that is as dedicated and passionate about software engineering as I am. I enjoy building things and seeing a plan come together, and my work is a natural extension of that.

When I'm not developing software, I like to play racketball, support the live music scene, and catch the latest movies. In my free time I also enjoy tinkering with new projects or gadgets and staying active in the San Antonio development community.
